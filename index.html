<p class="p_text";>Fashion was always in my life. It was intertwignend with everything i did and still do. But it started when i received my first Vogue.<br> 
    I was mezmerized by the models, colors, advertisement but especially the life!
    The clothes that the models wore were embellished and layered with glitters and glamour. Every single page. It was just a joy and pleasure to go through the hundreds of pages, even more after an exam or stressful day.
On this page i will introduce you to several designers and their collections of Fall 2018 whom inspired me, but most of all, designed my way of living!</p>

<p class="p_text";> Most of the time designers start every season and every collection with insprations and sometimes muses. For example, Ralph Lauren uses his wife as his muse for a few decades already.<br>
As with Christian Louboutin, who brought back Kate Moss silhouette in one of his creations called "So Kate". The shoe is now available in different colors and prizes.<br>
What i see in the collections every season is a reflexion of society, and with that you also see a change in society. We are changing all the time and apparently each of us has a small contribution 
towards it.</p>
<p class="p_text";>Fashion allows society changes everytime. Fashion is very flexible and resilient towards us human beings. The 'new' designers are an example of that. Eventhough Alexander Wang or Cushnie et Ochs<br>
are already for 10 years in business, they still are seen as 'new' compared to Oscar de la Renta, Karl Lagerfeld, Carolina Herrera, etc.</p>

<p class="p_text";>Preliminary, besides skecthes , you often see that the designers also like to be involved with the make of the materials for their creations.
    As with society changes, you see a change in selection of materials as well. The choices for sustainable materials has been progressed. More designers
are looking for fabrics which are good for the skin and the nature.  </p>
